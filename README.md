Famina CMS
==========

Famina CMS is the porting of my Yii 1.1 CMS that is being used in many sites.

FEATURES
--------

This is the very early stage of the project. Features are limited but expect something nice and fun

* One code base for multiple websites.
* A neat Admin Control Panel
* Customizable parameters

Be aware that this CMS does NOT use Advance application template. It needs its template to
support multiple sites. The Yii2 Advanced template's features are preserved and improved.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this CMS is that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.

INSTALLATION
------------

Adding installer app. You will be able to install this CMS via a GUI.

As it's based on Yii2, developers will need to prepare their development environment following Yii Framework document. The CMS doesn't require
you to create an Yii2 application before installing. Yet you still need Composer for your future development tasks.

### Install Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install the application using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:1.0.0-beta4"
~~~
